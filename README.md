# V2X_Communication
Project in which communication between different nodes (cars & traffic light) is achieved, in an attempt to provide a functional communication system that aims in the increase of safety in driving. Information is shared between the nodes in an effective manner, in order for the drivers to gain a better understanding of their surrounding.
It is basically a project concerning 'Vehicle to Vehicle' & 'Vehicle to Infrastructure' Communication.
The ALOHA protocol was used in the network implemented with Arduino, although the general mathematical analysis includes the use of other protocols.
